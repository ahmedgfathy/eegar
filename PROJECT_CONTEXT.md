# Eegar - Real Estate CRM Project Context

## Project Overview
Eegar is a modern, responsive CRM application built specifically for real estate professionals to manage leads, contacts, and properties. The project was recently renamed from "whatscrm" to "eegar".

## Recent Major Changes (June 20, 2025)

### 1. Project Renaming
- **OLD**: whatscrm → **NEW**: eegar
- Updated all configuration files, documentation, and folder names
- GitHub repository should be renamed from `whatscrm` to `eegar`

### 2. Logo Component Evolution
- Started with text + icon logo showing "اي ايجار" 
- Evolved to icon-only design (Building icon in blue gradient container)
- Removed Arabic text per user request
- Multiple iterations on sizing and spacing
- Current state: Clean, minimal icon-only logo in three sizes (small, medium, large)

### 3. Font Size Fixes
- Reduced oversized fonts throughout the application
- Hero section title: `text-8xl` → `text-5xl`
- Hero subtitle: `text-4xl` → `text-xl`
- Search bar elements: `py-5 px-8` → `py-3 px-3`
- Section titles: `text-6xl` → `text-4xl`
- Header height: `h-24` → `h-20`

### 4. Complete User Authentication System
- **Multi-step Registration**: Mobile number (Egyptian format) → SMS verification → Password creation
- **Login System**: Mobile number + password authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Automatic redirects for unauthenticated users
- **Mock API**: Complete user management with SMS simulation
- **Persistence**: Authentication state stored in localStorage

### 5. User Management Features
- **User Dashboard**: Comprehensive dashboard with property listings, statistics
- **Tabbed Interface**: Properties, Profile, Settings tabs
- **User Statistics**: Cards showing total properties, favorites, views
- **Property Management**: View and manage property listings

## Technical Stack

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom gradients
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **Routing**: React Router DOM 7.6.2
- **Forms**: React Hook Form with Yup validation
- **Backend**: Mock API (ready for real backend integration)

## Key Components
1. **Logo Component** (`src/components/Logo.tsx`): Icon-only, three sizes
2. **Authentication Context** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`): Global auth state
3. **Protected Routes** (`src/components/ProtectedRoute.tsx`): Route protection
4. **User Dashboard** (`src/pages/UserDashboard.tsx`): Main user interface

## Current Status

- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Development server running on http://localhost:3001
- ✅ Authentication system fully functional
- ✅ Logo refined to icon-only design
- ✅ Font sizes optimized throughout
- ⏳ GitHub repository needs manual renaming to "eegar"

## Next Steps Recommendations
1. Rename GitHub repository from "whatscrm" to "eegar" in GitHub settings
2. Integrate with real SMS service for authentication
3. Replace mock API with actual backend
4. Add more user management features
5. Implement property favorites system
6. Add property search and filtering

## Important Notes for AI Assistant
- User prefers minimal, clean design
- Spacing between logo elements was a major concern (multiple iterations)
- Font sizes needed significant reduction from initial implementation
- Arabic text was removed from logo per user request
- Project uses Egyptian phone number format validation
- Authentication is mobile-first (no email registration)

```

## Database Configuration
